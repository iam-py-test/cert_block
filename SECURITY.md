## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities via email to iam-py-test@protonmail.com<br>
Out of scope:
- attacks against infrastructure I don't own (i.e. GitHub)
- attacks which require root access or malware on the user's machine<br>
This is a browser extension, not an app. There's nothing it can do about malware changing parts of the user's browser.
